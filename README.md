# 🛡️ SOC Labs & Blue Team Projects

By Yusuf Usman — Cybersecurity Analyst (Blue Team)

Hands-on SOC operations • Detection engineering • Threat hunting

## 👨‍💻 About

This repository contains my end-to-end SOC Analyst portfolio, built from real-world defensive security labs.
Each project replicates enterprise environments using Microsoft Sentinel, Wazuh, Suricata, Defender, KQL, MITRE ATT&CK, and SIEM engineering.

My goal is to demonstrate practical Blue Team capability — not theory.

This repo includes:
	•	Full SOC home lab builds
	•	Network + endpoint log pipelines
	•	Custom detections
	•	MITRE ATT&CK–mapped investigations
	•	Threat hunting playbooks
	•	Incident response write-ups
